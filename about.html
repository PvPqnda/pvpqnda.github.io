      <span>Hey there! I'm PvPqnda, and I'm a Minecraft content creator.<br>Here's all you need to know about
        me!<br><br>
        <h5>The Beginning</h5>
        My journey started back in 2013, when I first discovered a block in Minecraft called the command block. I wanted
        to create something cool with it, so I created a simple TNT PvP map, called
        <a href="https://www.minecraftmaps.com/pvp-maps/bomb-battle" target="_blank">Bomb Battle</a>.
      </span>
      <figure class="figure">

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">I know it's not the prettiest map, alright? &#128521;</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <span>
        First I only played the map with my friends, but then they suggested to post the map online and let other people
        enjoy it too. That's how I got into mapmaking.<br>
      </span>

        <h5>The Parkour</h5>
        After I posted a few minigame maps, I wanted to create something else. I've always enjoyed playing parkour maps
        in
        Minecraft, so my idea was to create one myself. I created a map with 100 different rooms, came up with a catchy
        name (Parkour Paradise), and posted it online.

          <figcaption class="figure-caption">The original Parkour Paradise map.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        To my surprise, the map blew up, and now Parkour Paradise has over 170 thousand downloads! That's when I knew I
        had talent for map making, specifically parkour maps.<br>
        Over the years I've created several parkour maps.

        <h5>The Marketplace</h5>
        Since late 2019, I've become an official Minecraft Partner! This means I can offer my maps at the Minecraft
        Marketplace.<br>I'm currently working on bringing my Java maps to the Marketplace, while at the same time improving them so they are the best they can be when they hit the Marketplace!
