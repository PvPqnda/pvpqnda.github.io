      <span>Hey there! I'm PvPqnda, and I'm a Minecraft content creator.<br>Here's all you need to know about me!<br><br>
        <h5>The Early Days</h5>
        I started making maps back in 2012, but on my Xbox 360 since I didn't have a computer at the time. I would create maps for fun, but I would only be able to play them with friends since I had nothing to publish them with. They were only on my Xbox 360, anyway.<br><br>
        A few years later, I purchased my first computer and very quickly took interest in map making. This time, it was for the enjoyment of the community online, rather than just myself and friends.
        I didn't yet know much about commands or command blocks, as they weren't on the Xbox 360 edition of the game. I began putting my heart and soul into learning how they worked with my new computer, while figuring out how to use them in such a way to create a functional minigame, because commands and command blocks greatly intrigued me.<br><br>
        When I felt somewhat ready, I began working on a simple PvP minigame to make as my first public map. This turned out to be
        <a href="https://www.minecraftmaps.com/pvp-maps/death-by-cactus" target="_blank"style="text-decoration: underline;">"Death By Cactus"</a>. To my surprise, it now has over a thousand downloads on the
        <a href="https://www.minecraftmaps.com" target="_blank"style="text-decoration: underline;">Minecraft Maps</a>
        website, even though it was a simple creation to experiment with map making and get me started.<br>
        I continued to make a few more maps for fun, practice, and to gain experience, even though most of them were never finished.

        <h5>Hielke</h5>
        <a href="https://hielkemaps.com" target="_blank"style="text-decoration: underline;">Hielke</a>
        has become a very good friend of mine. (He even helped me put this website together!)<br>
        Back in the day, I was a fan of his famous parkour maps that I always used to watch
        <a href="http://youtube.com/PrestonPlayz" target="_blank"style="text-decoration: underline;">PrestonPlayz</a>
        play on YouTube.<br>
        One afternoon in late 2017, I met Hielke on a server. Long story short, he brought me in to help him with a new map he was making called
        <a href="https://www.minecraftmaps.com/parkour-maps/parkour-pyramid" target="_blank"style="text-decoration: underline;">"Parkour Pyramid"<a>.
        It is currently on Minecraft Realms, and has over a hundred thousand downloads on the
        <a href="https://www.minecraftmaps.com" target="_blank"style="text-decoration: underline;">Minecraft Maps</a>
        website!

          <figcaption class="figure-caption">A screenshot of the Parkour Pyramid map</figcaption>
        </figure>
        Around halfway through Parkour Pyramid's creation, Hielke suggested I join him on PrestonPlayz's private map making team! This was because he knew I very much enjoyed creating maps, and as it was a job that I could earn money from. My previous work was examined, and I was accepted onto the team. And that's how I got into professional map making.<br><br>
        I spent the following year or so creating maps that Preston requested I make, and earned money in return for the maps. In fact, I technically still am. Now, I work with a few others, as well.<br><br>
        Later on, Hielke and I decided to create a map together, which ended up becoming
        <a href="/maps/arrow-fight" target="_blank"style="text-decoration: underline;">"Arrow Fight"<a>.<br>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption">A screenshot of the Arrow Fight map</figcaption>
        </figure>
        After finishing Arrow Fight, I got it ready for a submission to Minecraft Realms, and it was accepted.
      </p>

        <h5>Realms</h5>
        I had been wanting to become a Realms Mapmaker for years, and when Arrow Fight was accepted to Realms, that dream came true.<br>
        Since that day, I have published a total of 3 maps onto Realms, all of which you can download
        <a href="/maps" style="color: #dc3545;text-decoration: underline;">here<a>, with more to come!<br><br>
        I'm still constantly learning new things with map making, and how to make maps even better and more efficient. I really love creating maps for everyone to enjoy, and I hope you have fun playing them!
