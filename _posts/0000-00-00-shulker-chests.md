*For Minecraft 1.17+*

**Datapack Features:**

- Enables chests to keep their items inside when broken!

- Breaking a container will drop the chest with the items still inside, without dropping all of the contents everywhere.

- Placing a container back down will retain any items that were still inside!

- Even works in creative mode!

- This affects chests, trapped chests, and barrels!

- Filled containers will display their contents in text when hovered over in an inventory just like shulker boxes!

- Supports the Expanded Storage mod v7.3.11 for both Forge and the Fabric Loader!

- Admins may type "/function shulkerchests:admin_info" to toggle individual categories of containers!
