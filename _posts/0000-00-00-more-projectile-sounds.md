**Datapack Features:**

- Adds sounds to projectiles when they land that normally don't have any sound upon landing at all!

- Landing sounds are added to snowballs, eggs, and ender pearls.

- Admins may toggle each projectile's landing sounds with these commands:
"/function moreprojectilesounds:toggle/snowballs"
"/function moreprojectilesounds:toggle/eggs"
"/function moreprojectilesounds:toggle/ender_pearls"
