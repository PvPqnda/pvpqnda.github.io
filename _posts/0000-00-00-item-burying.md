*For Minecraft {{page.java-version}}*

**Datapack Features:**

   * Makes droppers and dispensers able to drop/dispense items into sand or gravel, making the block suspicious with your item as the loot inside!<br>
      <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="/img/datapacks/item-burying/demo.gif">

   * Running "/scoreboard players set #RequireDropper ItemBurying 0" disables the requirement of dropper/dispenser usage for burying items, allowing the following methods to be possible:
       * Placing sand/gravel inside a dropped item
       * Letting sand/gravel fall onto a dropped item
       * Dispensing items up through multiple blocks, burying them as they ascend

*Survival & Multiplayer friendly*
