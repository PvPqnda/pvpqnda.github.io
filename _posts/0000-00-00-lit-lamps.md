**Datapack Features:**

- Drop any number of Redstone Lamps and the same amount of Redstone Torches on the ground to craft Lit Lamps!

- Placing a Lit Lamp will place a Redstone Lamp, that is lit with just the redstone torch inside of it!<br>
Note that if you break or place a block next to a lit lamp after the lit lamp has been placed, it will tell the lit lamp that it isn't being powered by anything, causing it to become unlit.

- When you break a Lit Lamp, or when it's updated and becomes unlit, the redstone torch used to craft it will pop out to get back!
