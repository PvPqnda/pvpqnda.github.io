**Changelog:**

**v1.1.0** - *June 13, 2021*

- Added 1.17 support and added some of the new 1.17 blocks to the blocks that can be cut by thrown swords (Pointed Dripstone, Amethyst Buds/Clusters, Dripleaves, Azalea, Glow Lichen, Cave Vines, and Hanging Roots)
- Scaffolding and leaves are now also able to be cut by thrown swords
- Only one glass can be broken per sword thrown; same goes for the addition of leaves and pointed dripstone
- Lit candles can be put out if a sword is thrown past them
