*For Minecraft 1.16+*

**Datapack Features:**

- Adds landmines into the game!

- Craft a landmine by dropping 1 TNT and 1 button of any kind!

- Stepping on a landmine will activate it, but once nothing is on the landmine anymore, it explodes!

- Mobs can detonate landmines too!

- If you find yourself standing on a landmine, you can swap yourself with another mob or entity like an arrow or trident to keep the activated landmine occupied so you can get to safety!

- Placing a landmine in the overworld gives it a default stone base.<br>
Placing a landmine on a sandy block will give it a desert camouflage!<br>
Placing a landmine in the nether will give it a nether camouflage!<br>
Placing a landmine in the end will give it an end camouflage!<br>
However, they all have a visible red button on top.

- Hide landmines under grass, minecart rails, and more!

- Admins may type "/function lm:count_landmines" to see how many landmines are placed, or "/function lm:remove_landmines" to remove all placed landmines!
