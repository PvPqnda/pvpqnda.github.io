**Datapack Features:**

- When you die, a message will appear in your chat. This message will contain two types of information, including the coordinates of the position in which you died at, and the dimension you were in when you died.

- Typing "/trigger DeathPoint" will send you a similar message stating where you were at your last death point.

*Survival & Multiplayer friendly*
