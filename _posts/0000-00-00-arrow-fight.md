Map Description:

Both teams will be sent to their team's island where they will quickly gather resources to prepare for the chaos that will soon strike them.
You may craft armor, weapons... ect, but you will primarily be purchasing unique arrows that each have their own special abilities. For example, the TNT Arrow spawns in 1 TNT when the arrow lands. And the Fire Arrow lights nearby blocks on fire when the arrow lands.
You may use the custom arrows to eliminate the opposing team. Once all players on their team is dead, the other team wins. However, you are unable to build from island to island.

Marc from Mojang:

"Resource gathering and careful exploration in the face of adversity are a theme as old as humanity itself, and the two team/two island setup speaks to the duality wihin us all."
