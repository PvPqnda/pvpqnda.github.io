*For Minecraft 1.19*

**Map Description:**

Both teams will be sent to their team's island where they will quickly gather resources to prepare for the chaos that will soon strike them.<br>
You may craft armor, weapons... ect, but you will primarily be purchasing unique arrows that each have their own special abilities.<br>
For example, the TNT Arrow spawns in 1 TNT when the arrow lands. And the Fire Arrow lights nearby blocks on fire when the arrow lands.<br>
You may use the custom arrows to eliminate the opposing team.<br>
Once all players on their team is dead, the other team wins. However, you are unable to build from island to island.

- 2+ players!
- Cosmetic features!
- 6 unique maps to play on!
- Many different arrows with special abilities!
- Custom resource pack!

**Marc from Mojang:**

"Resource gathering and careful exploration in the face of adversity are a theme as old as humanity itself, and the two team/two island setup speaks to the duality within us all."
