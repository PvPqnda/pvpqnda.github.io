**Marc from Mojang:**

"Most gamers are familiar with arena combat, where you defeat mobs one after the other in an enclosed area, attempting to survive until the very end. Underwater Mob Arena takes that concept to new depths as you complete wave after wave of aquatic combat. Defeating enemies will let you purchase upgrades to weapons, armor, or even powerful items with special abilities, such as sucking in nearby mobs or blowing your foes sky high."
