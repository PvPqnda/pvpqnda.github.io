**Map Description:**

400 Levels is a large parkour adventure map with, you guessed it, 400 small levels of rainbow parkour (with countless other unique levels within it) which all together should take you around 1 hour to complete!

- 1+ players!
- Many different unique levels!
- Nice and chill fun parkour!
- Good for parkour training!
- Multiplayer friendly!

**Marc from Mojang:**

"We started this journey today on a parkour adventure that was, for the most part, a single cohesive run. 
In this map, we have its thematic opposite. While you can still complete this in one run, this map is broken up into four hundred mini parkour challenges.<br>Theyâ€™re quick and bite-sized, with the difficulty ramping up and down in a satisfying way."
