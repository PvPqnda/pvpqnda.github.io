We started this journey today on a parkour adventure that was, for the most part, a single cohesive run. 
In this map, we have its thematic opposite. While you can still complete this in one run, this map is broken up into four hundred mini parkour challenges. 

They’re quick and bite-sized, with the difficulty ramping up and down in a satisfying way.
